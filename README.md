In this Project we will be developing a full stack application using Spring Boot
and Angular 7 and performing JWT Authentication.<br>

In previous tutorial we had implemented - 
	<a href="https://www.javainuse.com/spring/ang7-basic-interceptor">Angular 7 + Spring Boot Basic Auth Using HTTPInterceptor Example</a> 
	to intercept all
	outgoing HTTP Requests and add basic authentication string to them. In this tutorial we will be
	modifying the application to perform authentication using JSON Web Token.
